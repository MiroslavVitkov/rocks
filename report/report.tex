\section{Introduction}
The task is to classify rock samples in one of six classes.
The input datapoints are 7810-element arrays.
The SVM model showed best promise.


\section{Dataset}
The dataset consists of 2362 datapoints all classified within the 6 labels and 45 sublabels.
The reference number of the dataset is 190401.


\section{Preprocessing}
The data is not being preprocessed, despite obvious indicators of noise.


\section{Random Chance}
First, for sanity checking of the system, a random chance model was developed.
It looks only at the distribution of training labels and produces a similar distribution at prediction time.
One example output is <>.


\section{Correlation}
With such a small dataset, correlation is feisable.
It yields good results, but is not scalable.


\section{SVM}
The SVM model performs well and runs quickly at prediction time.

\section{Neural Network}
A naive model with two hidden layers with relu activations performed extremely poorly: <>.
It is unclear if this is due to programming errors or due to wrong architecture of the network.


\section{Random Forest}
A OpenMP-based random forest classifier took extremely long to train and yielded the following result:


\section{Conclusion}
An SVM is a suitable baseline model for multiclass classification of high dimensionality objects.
